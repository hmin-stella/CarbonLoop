# ACT: Architectural Carbon Modeling Tool

## Abstract
**Motivation:** Over the past two decades, the world has witnessed a dramatic rise in computing across data centers, mobile, and communication technologies. As of 2015 information computing technology (ICT) accounts for up to 3% of global carbon emissions. Unfortunately, as the demand for computing grows with new applications and platforms so will its energy demand. Many technology companies, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon, have pledged to reduce their carbon footprints over the next decade. Meeting these pledges and enabling sustainable computing requires immediate action from the systems and architecture community.

**Background:** In addition to its importance, enabling environmentally sustainable computing introduces unique challenges to system and hardware design. First, carbon emissions are shifting from being dominated by operational energy consumption to hardware manufacturing. Traditionally the majority of emissions owe to operational hardware use (i.e., energy consumption). However, given the energy efficiency optimizations and increasing fabrication complexity, the majority of carbon emissions have shifted to hardware manufacturing. Given these new challenges, enabling environmentally sustainable computing demands distinct solutions across the computing stack, hardware life cycles, and end-to-end systems.

**This tutorial:** A fundamental bottleneck to conducting sustainability aware hardware design space exploration and optimization is the lack of carbon accounting tools. To address this gap, here we propose a tutorial for ACT, the first-of-its-kind architectural carbon modeling tool. ACT enables computer architects to quantify the embodied carbon footprint of hardware during early design space exploration — allowing designers to consider carbon as a first-order optimization target alongside performance, power, and energy. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a holistic overview of the sustainability implications of modern computer systems at the datacenter and mobile scale (motivation for ACT), an overview of the proposed ACT methodology, hands on demonstration for how to use ACT, and hands on demonstration for how to extend ACT in new ways. We believe such a tutorial will build a strong foundation for researchers across computer architecture, circuits and VLSI, and systems, to incorporate carbon analyses in their research.

## This tutorial
The inaugural `ACT` tutorial will be held at [MICRO 2022](https://www.microarch.org/micro55/) in Chicago and presented by Udit Gupta.
